## Overview

The main goal of this lab is to have students think more about performance metrics, especially those used for classification.

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the questions provided in `LO8_assessment_revisited.html`. A template is provided (rename as `lastname_firstname_L08.qmd`).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which should contain a link to your github repo. Including the github repo link takes the place of having to submit the additional qmd and r files. See canvas for submission details.
